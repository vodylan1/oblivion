# phase_history.md

## Phase 1
- Created folder structure and placeholder files for all modules.
- Minimal docstrings added to each file as placeholders.




## Phase 1
- Established project folder structure and created placeholder files for each module.
- Included minimal docstrings and doc placeholders for easy reference.
- Prepared for Phase 2, where we will begin wiring up data pipelines, synergy logic, and basic execution flows.


## Phase 3
- Introduced a minimal ReflectionEngine that logs trade outcomes to reflection_logs.md.
- Added a simple PatchCore module with a dummy request_autopatch() function.
- Implemented EGO_CORE with a basic emotional overlay that can alter synergy decisions.
- main.py now integrates these flows:
  1) Logs trade results after each decision,
  2) Checks for negative streaks to trigger autopatch requests,
  3) Demonstrates how emotional states can tilt final synergy outputs.


## Phase 4
- Integrated SCORING_ENGINE to produce a basic risk–reward score (0–100).
- Modified synergy logic to consider both agent signals and the SCORING_ENGINE score.
- Introduced a minimal KILL_SWITCH system that checks recent PnL in reflection_engine trade_history.
- If total PnL in the last 5 trades < -50, the kill switch triggers a system freeze.


## Phase 5
- Introduced concurrency via a background thread that scans for whale activity (GodAwareness).
- If suspicious activity is detected, synergy can shift to a fear emotional state in EGO_CORE.
- synergy_conductor_run continues to incorporate SCORING_ENGINE + agent logic, but now can be influenced by real-time whale alerts.
- The system can now handle multiple loops (or eventually multiple concurrent strategies) without blocking the on-chain scanning.
