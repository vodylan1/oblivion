## Phase 1
- Created folder structure and placeholder files for all modules.
- Minimal docstrings added to each file as placeholders.




## Phase 1
- Established project folder structure and created placeholder files for each module.
- Included minimal docstrings and doc placeholders for easy reference.
- Prepared for Phase 2, where we will begin wiring up data pipelines, synergy logic, and basic execution flows.


## Phase 3
- Introduced a minimal ReflectionEngine that logs trade outcomes to reflection_logs.md.
- Added a simple PatchCore module with a dummy request_autopatch() function.
- Implemented EGO_CORE with a basic emotional overlay that can alter synergy decisions.
- main.py now integrates these flows:
  1) Logs trade results after each decision,
  2) Checks for negative streaks to trigger autopatch requests,
  3) Demonstrates how emotional states can tilt final synergy outputs.
